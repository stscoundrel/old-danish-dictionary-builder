# Old Danish Dictionary Builder

Build machine-readable version of Otto Kalkar's "Dictionary of the Old Danish Language".

Currently work-in-progress, but the goal is to offer JSON dataset with normalized dictionary data. It might very well end up being a slow process which requires a lot of manual labor, but we'll see how far we can get with code alone.

## Current features:
- Downloads all scanned pages.
- Feeds images to image-to-text (OCR) library.

## Upcoming features
- Parse ORC results to machine-readable structured formats.
